This is a tutorial project refactored from the Udacity course: [Intro to TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187).



### About
The objective of this project was to create and train my first neural network that recognizes images of clothing. To focus attention away from environment and package management, I chose to develop within Google Colab. You can run my project there: 

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/DFazekas/Colab2_Fashion_MNIST/blob/master/Colab2_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab" title="Open in Colab" /></a>

The dataset provides 70,000 low-resolution images of clothing articles within 10 categories (shirts, sandels, pants etc.). Each sample is a 24x24 pixel image, as shown below.

### Tech

This neural network leverages a number of libraries:

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - machine learning platform.
* [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds) - collection of datasets ready to use in TensorFlow.
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - neural network API.
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - scientific computing functions.
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - visualization tools.
